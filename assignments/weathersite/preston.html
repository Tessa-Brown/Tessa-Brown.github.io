            <h2>All About Preston</h2>
            <p><em>By APG West</em></p>

            <p>The Preston Citizen is located in the county seat of Franklin County, Idaho, 
                about 30 miles north of Logan, Utah. It has been the voice of the county since 
                the late 1890s, as the Franklin County Citizen. The largest communities served 
                by the newspaper include, Preston, Franklin, Weston, and Dayton, along  with 
                about 10 smaller towns. The total population of Franklin County is just under
                13,000. Preston city has a population of just over 5,000. The Citizen was long
                recognized as the community newspaper, but it also served as the printing source
                for many locals. Whether it was off of the web press that produced the newspaper,
                or sheet feet products, the Citizen has been a major player in the printing business.
                Known for their community service, former owners Walter Ross and Wayne Bell both
                served as mayor of Preston at one time. In fact, Bell and Ross were the driving force
                behind a community event that has been going strong for over 30 years. The Festival
                of Lights is a two-day event that draws thousands of people to Preston for the
                festivities and lighted night parade. The community is also home to the That Famous 
                Preston Night Rodeo in July, which draws the top national cowboys to the yearly event. 
                In August, the Franklin County Fair is held at the fairgrounds.In 2004
                a little independent film debuted featuring an odd teenager, Napoleon
                Dynamite, trying to fit in. The film, produced by Preston native Jared Hess,
                went on to become a cult classic and has made Preston a tourist destination
                for movie buffs. Franklin county has excellent community services, two excellent
                school districts (West Side and Preston), 
                and extension offices for Idaho  State
                University and the University of Idaho.</p><br>
